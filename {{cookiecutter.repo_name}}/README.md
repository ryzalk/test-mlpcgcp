## Preface

### Repository Setup

This repository provides an end-to-end template for AI
Singapore's AI engineers to onboard their AI projects. This repository
was created using AI Singapore's
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
template located
[here](https://github.com/aimakerspace/ml-project-cookiecutter-gcp).
Instructions for generating this template is detailed in that
repository's `README.md`.

While this repository provides users with a set of boilerplates,
with this `README.md` document, you are presented with a linear guide on
how to use the boilerplates that are rendered when you generated this
repository using [`cruft`](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/).
You can follow along the guide but it will be tackling a simple problem
statement.
Once you've grasp what this template offers, you can deviate from it
and customise it to your needs.

Since we will be making use of this repository and the files
contained within it, __ensure that this repository is pushed to a
remote repository__.
Most probably you will be resorting to
[AI Singapore's GitLab instance](https://gitlab.aisingapore.net/) as
the remote.
Refer to
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/working_with_projects.html#create-a-project)
on creating a blank remote repository (or project in GitLab's term).
After creating the remote repository, retrieve the remote URL and push
the local repository to remote:

```bash
$ git init
$ git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit."
$ git push -u origin master
```

### Guide's Problem Statement

For this guide, we will work towards building a predictive model that is
able to conduct sentiment classification for movie reviews.
The model is then to be deployed through a REST API and used for batch
inferencing as well.
The raw dataset to be used is made available for you to download;
instructions are detailed under
["Data Storage & Versioning"](#data-storage--versioning),
to be referred to later on.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Projects

Each project in AI Singapore that requires the usage of GCP resources
would be provided with a
[GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects). Such
projects would be accessible through the
[GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home) once you've logged
into your AI Singapore Google account. Projects are managed and
provisioned by AI Singapore's MLOps team. If you'd like to request for a
project to be created (or for any other enquiries as well), please
contact `mlops@aisingapore.org`.

#### Authorisation

You can use GCP's [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) to interact
with the varying GCP services.
When you're using the SDK for the first time,
you are to provide authorisation using a user or service account. In AI
Singapore's context, unless your use case concerns some automation or
CI/CD pipelines, you will probably be using your user account
(i.e. Google accounts with AI Singapore domains such as
`@aisingapore.org` or `@aiap.sg`).
See [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing) for more
information on authorising your SDK.

A simple command to authorise access:

```bash
$ gcloud auth login
```

To register `gcloud` for Docker so you can push to
Google Container Registry:

```bash
$ gcloud auth configure-docker
```

With your user account, you should have access to the following GCP
products/services:

- [Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- [Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

## MLOps Components & Platform

### Kubernetes

We will be using
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
as the orchestration tool to execute
pipelines and manage containerised applications and environments.

From the Kubernetes site:

> Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating
> deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
> It groups containers that make up an application into logical units
> for easy management and discovery.

A number of services and applications that you will be interacting with
(or deploying) are deployed (to be deployed) within a GKE cluster
environment. A GKE cluster should be set up upon creation of your GCP
project, viewable
[here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview).
If this is not the case, please notify the MLOps team at
`mlops@aisingapore.org`.

Some of the MLOps components which the GKE environment will be
relevant for are:

- Developer Workspace
- Model Experimentation
- Experiment Tracking
- Data/Artifact Storage
- Model Serving

What this means is that AI engineers would need to be able to access the
GKE cluster. Documentation for obtaining a cluster's configuration can
be found
[here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry).

#### `kubectl` Configuration for GKE

If you would like to view or create Kubernetes (GKE) resources within
development environments (or even on your own local machine), you can
run the following command to connect to the
`tekong-exp-cluster` cluster which by default
your user or service account
should have access to:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials tekong-exp-cluster --zone asia-southeast1-c --project {{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}
```

Since the service account is granted limited permissions,
you would not be able to carry out certain actions with the
cluster (view namespaces, delete resources, etc).

After obtaining the credentials and configurations for the GKE cluster,
you can start to interact with the main MLOps platforms tool that you
will be leveraging on for a development workspace, data preparation as
well as model training.

Reference(s):

- [GKE Overview](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview)

#### Persistent Volumes

Containers are ephemeral and what that translates to is that any data
created and stored within the container as well as any changes made to
it will be gone once the container is stopped. To persist these things,
we would need to mount volumes to the containers. With the default
configuration provided in this template, any services or jobs to be
spun up on the MLOps platform Polyaxon will have a persistent volume
attached. The volume's mount path is `/polyaxon-v1-data` and so
anything that is stored within that path will be persisted.

Reference(s):

- [Kubernetes Docs - Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
- [NetApp - What are Kubernetes persistent volumes?](https://www.netapp.com/knowledge-center/what-is-kubernetes-persistent-volumes/)

### Polyaxon

[Polyaxon](https://polyaxon.com) is an MLOps platform that provides a
suite of features for AI engineers to facilitate their end-to-end
machine learning workflows. The platform is to be deployed on a GKE
cluster; the Platforms and MLOps team would have set the platform up for
your team upon creation of the GCP project. AI engineers need not worry
about having to administer the platform as end-consumers of the
platform.

To verify if Polyaxon has been deployed on your GKE cluster, run the
following command:

```bash
$ helm list --namespace polyaxon-v1
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                       STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
polyaxon        polyaxon-v1     X               2021-XX-XX XX:XX:XX +0800 +08 deployed        polyaxon-1.11.3 1.11.3
```

An output similar to the one above should be returned.

#### Polyaxon Dashboard

Now, let's access the dashboard for Polyaxon. Before we can interact
with the platform, we have to install the Polyaxon CLI. This should
ideally be done within a virtual Python environment. You can
conveniently get the relevant libraries for this guide by executing the
following command:

```bash
$ conda env create -f {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env.yml
```

At any point of time you would like __to interact with the Polyaxon
server, you would need port forwarding of the Polyaxon Kubernetes
service to your localhost__.
You can do port forwarding to a port on the localhost with
the Polyaxon CLI (we'll go ahead with the port `8888`):

```bash
$ polyaxon port-forward --port=8888 --namespace=polyaxon-v1 &
```

Open up a browser and head over to `localhost:8888`. You should see an
interface as such:

![Polyaxon v1 - Projects Dashboard](./assets/screenshots/polyaxon-v1-projects-dashboard.png)

Before we can create any services or run jobs on the platform, we have
to configure the host for the CLI and create a project within the
platform:

```bash
$ polyaxon config set --host=http://localhost:8888
$ polyaxon project create --name {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME>
```

After the command above, you should see a project with the name you've
specified above in the
[projects dashboard](http://localhost:8888/ui/orgs/default/projects).

#### Relevant Concepts

Before we proceed further, let's cover some basic concepts that one
should know when getting started with Polyaxon.

__Polyaxonfiles:__

To submit jobs or spin up services on the Polyaxon platform, users would
have to make use of both the CLI as well as Polyaxon-specific config
files known as Polyaxonfiles. The CLI establishes communications and
connections with the Polyaxon server while Polyaxonfiles provide
specification to the server for the kind of request you are making.
Polyaxonfiles can be written and defined in several formats
(YAML, JSON, Python, and some other languages) but in
AI Singapore's context, we will be sticking with YAML.

Head over [here](https://polyaxon.com/docs/core/specification/) for the
official documentation on Polyaxonfiles.

__Components:__

Before you can define a job or service for Polyaxon, you would have to
call upon and define a component. Hence, in every Polyaxonfile that is
provided as an example, you see the following lines
at the very beginning:

```yaml
version: 1.1
kind: component
...
```

From the official documentation:

> Component is a discrete, repeatable, and self-contained action that
> defines an environment and a runtime.

Essentially, a "component" is to represent a discrete aspect of your
end-to-end workflow. You can have a component for your development
environment, one for your data preparation pipeline, and another for
your model training workflow. You can also have different components for
different variations of your pipelines. However these workflows are to
be defined, they all start with specifying a component.
Shown [here](https://polyaxon.com/docs/intro/concepts/runtime-concepts/),
you can specify various runtimes
(experimentation tools) you would like to spin up through the Polyaxon
server.

__Reference(s):__

- [Polyaxon Docs - Component Specification](https://polyaxon.com/docs/intro/quick-start/components/)
- [Polyaxon Docs - Polyaxon experimentation tools](https://polyaxon.com/docs/experimentation/)

__Jobs:__

One example of such components is "jobs". You can run jobs for training
models, data preprocessing or any generic tasks that are executable
within Docker images. Whenever you need to execute a pipeline or a
one-off task, "jobs" is the right runtime to go for.

__Reference(s):__

- [Polyaxon Docs - Jobs Introduction](https://polyaxon.com/docs/experimentation/jobs/)

__Services:__

The "services" runtime is used for spinning up applications or
interfaces that are to remain running until you stop the service
(or an error is faced on the server's end).
You can spin up services the likes of a VSCode editor that would
be accessible via a browser, a Jupyter Lab server or a REST API server.

__Reference(s):__

- [Polyaxon Docs - Services Introduction](https://polyaxon.com/docs/experimentation/)

We will dive deeper into these concepts and the usage of each one of
them in later sections.

#### Secrets & Credentials on Kubernetes

When executing jobs on Polyaxon, credentials are needed to access
various services like GCR or GCS. To provide your container jobs with
access to these credentials, you need to carry out the following:

1. Download a service account key to your local machine (or obtain it
   from the lead engineer/MLOps team) and rename it to
   `gcp-service-account.json`. Take note of the client email detailed
   in the JSON file. The client email should be of the following
   convention: `aisg-100e-sa@{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
2. Create a Kubernetes secret on your Kubernetes (GKE) cluster,
   within the same namespace where Polyaxon is deployed: `polyaxon-v1`.
3. Configure Polyaxonfiles to refer to these secrets.

Here are the commands to be executed for creating the secrets:

```bash
$ export SA_CLIENT_EMAIL="aisg-100e-sa@{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
$ export PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE=<PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE>
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry gcp-imagepullsecrets \
  --docker-server=https://asia.gcr.io \
  --docker-username=_json_key \
  --docker-email=$SA_CLIENT_EMAIL \
  --docker-password="$(cat $PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE)" \
  --namespace=polyaxon-v1
$ kubectl create secret generic gcp-sa-credentials \
  --from-file $PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE \
  --namespace=polyaxon-v1
```

Make sure that the Polyaxonfiles for the jobs and services that requires
your service account credentials have the following configurations:

```yaml
...
inputs:
  - name: SA_CRED_PATH
    description: Path to credential file for GCP service account.
    isOptional: true
    type: str
    value: /var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json
    toEnv: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
run:
  kind: job
  environment:
    imagePullSecrets: ["gcp-imagepullsecrets"]
  volumes:
    - name: gcp-service-account
      secret:
        secretName: "gcp-sa-credentials"
  container:
    volumeMounts:
      - name: gcp-service-account
        mountPath: /var/secret/cloud.google.com
...
```

### Google Container Registry

AI Singapore's emphases on reproducibility and portability of
workflows and accompanying environments translates to heavy usage of
containerisation. Throughout this guide, we will be building Docker
images necessary for setting up development environments, jobs for
the various pipelines and deployment of the predictive model.

Within the context of GCP, the
[Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
will be used to store and version our Docker images.
Following authorisation to `gcloud`, you can view the image repositories
of your project's registry like so:

```bash
$ gcloud container images list --repository=asia.gcr.io/{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}
```

You will be pushing the Docker images to the aforementioned repository.

Reference(s):

- [`gcloud` Reference - `gcloud container images list`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/images/list)
- [GCR Guide - Pushing & Pulling Images](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling)

## Development Environment

![Development Environment Section](./assets/images/eptg-section-banner-dev-env.png)]

An advantage presented by the Polyaxon platform is that you can utilise
the GKE cluster's resources for your development and engineering works
instead of your own resources. We can make use of
[Polyaxon services](https://polyaxon.com/docs/experimentation/services/#specification)
to spin up VSCode or Jupyter Lab servers with which cluster resources
can be dedicated (except for GPUs);
all you need on your end is a machine with WebSockets,
a browser and a terminal.

### VSCode

The VSCode service to be created will be using a Docker image. You
can use the Dockerfile that is provided out-of-the-box
`docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-poly-vscode.Dockerfile` to build a
Docker image to be pushed to your project's container registry (GCR) or
you can customise that same Dockerfile to your liking. Either way, you
are to specify the image to be used for the service.

```bash
$ export GCP_PROJECT_ID={{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/vscode-server:0.1.0 \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-poly-vscode.Dockerfile .
$ docker push asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/vscode-server:0.1.0
```

Push the configurations to the Polyaxon server to start up the VSCode
service:

```bash
$ polyaxon run -f aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/vscode-service.yml -P DOCKER_IMAGE="asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/vscode-server:0.1.0" -P WORKING_DIR='/polyaxon-v1-data' -p {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME>
```

The `-p` flag is used to specify the project for which you are
dedicating the service or job to.
The `-P` flag is used to pass an input for a parameter defined in the
Polyaxonfile that is in question. In this case, we are specifying to the
Polyaxon service that we intend to use the Docker image
`asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/vscode-server:0.1.0` and to
work from the path that we have
specified, which is `/polyaxon-v1-data` where data and artifacts will
be persisted.

Now head over to the services dashboard under your project. The link to
your services would be as such -
`http://localhost:8888/ui/default/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME>/services`
. The interface should look something like the following:

![Polyaxon v1 - Services Dashboard](./assets/screenshots/polyaxon-v1-services-dashboard.png)

To access the VSCode service, expand the service and click on the
`Service` tab:

![Polyaxon v1 - VSCode Service Run View](./assets/screenshots/polyaxon-v1-vscode-service-run-view.png)

The service you see here is embedded within Polyaxon's dashboard.
You can
click on the `Fullscreen` button to have a single browser tab be
dedicated to this service.

![Polyaxon v1- VSCode Service Interface](./assets/screenshots/polyaxon-v1-vscode-service-interface.png)

To open up the integrated terminal within the VSCode environment, you
can use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl + Shift + `</code>.

#### Git from VSCode

To clone or push to Git repositories within the VSCode integrated
terminal, you would have to first disable VSCode's Git authentication
handler:

1. Head over to `File > Preferences > Settings`.
2. Search for `git.terminalAuthentication`.
3. Uncheck the option.
4. Open a new integrated terminal.

### Jupyter Lab

While Jupyter Notebooks are viewable, editable and executable within
a VSCode environment, most are still more familiar with Jupyter's
interface for interacting with or editing notebooks. We can spin up
a Jupyter Lab service on Polyaxon:

```bash
$ export GCP_PROJECT_ID={{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/jupyter:0.1.0 \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-jupyter.Dockerfile .
$ docker push asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/jupyter:0.1.0
```

Push the configurations to the Polyaxon server to start up the Jupyter
service:

```bash
$ polyaxon run -f aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/jupyter-service.yml -P DOCKER_IMAGE="asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/jupyter:0.1.0" -P WORKING_DIR="/polyaxon-v1-data" -p {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME>
```

Now head over to the services dashboard under your project.
The service should be accompanied with the tags `jupyter`,
`notebook` and `lab`.

![Polyaxon v1- Jupyter Lab Service Interface](./assets/screenshots/polyaxon-v1-jupyter-service-interface.png)

### Using Docker within Polyaxon Services

A caveat: since these development environments are essentially pods
deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, using Docker within the pods
themselves is not feasible by default and while possible,
should be avoided.

Reference(s):

- [Polyaxon Docs - Run CLI Reference](https://polyaxon.com/docs/core/cli/run/)
- [Polyaxon - Integrations](https://polyaxon.com/integrations/)
- [Cloud SDK Reference - gcloud auth activate-service-account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account)
- [Using Docker-in-Docker for your CI or testing environment? Think twice. - jpetazzo](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/)

### Git Repository

Now that we have a development environment, we can clone this repository
into the environment's persistent storage. As the persistent storage
would be accessible by the rest of your project team members, __you
should only use the `HTTPS` protocol to clone the repository__
as opposed to using an `SSH` key.

The path to persistent storage on Polyaxon is located at
`/polyaxon-v1-data`. You can create your own workspace folder under
`/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>`:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>
$ sudo chown -R 2222:2222 /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces
$ cd /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>
$ git clone <REMOTE_URL_HTTPS>
$ cd {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}
```

### Cloud SDK for Development Environment

As mentioned [here](#secrets--credentials-on-kubernetes),
credentials or secrets can be attached to Polyaxon services or jobs
when configured properly. In doing so, you can make use of Google
service accounts to interact with GCP services or resources.

If you use the provided Dockerfiles to build Docker images for the
services on Polyaxon, the development environments would have the
Cloud SDK installed.
You can configure the `gcloud` CLI to make use of the
service account credentials attached to the VSCode and Jupyter services,
which its path is set to the environment variable
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

```bash
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account aisg-100e-sa@{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

Once the service account has been configured, examples of actions you
can carry out consists of the following:

- list objects within GCS buckets
- create objects within GCS buckets
- list deployed pods within a GKE cluster

The service account is granted a custom role with specific
permissions deemed needed by AI engineers.

## Virtual Environment

While the Docker images you will be using to run experiments on Polyaxon
would contain the conda environments you would need, you can also create
these virtual environments within your development environment, and have
it be persisted. The following set of commands allows you to create the
conda environment and store the packages within your own workspace
directory:

```bash
$ /home/coder/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ conda env create -f {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env.yml -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/conda_envs/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env
$ alias {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env="conda activate /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/conda_envs/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env"
$ {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env
```

## Data Storage & Versioning

![Data Storage & Versioning Banner](./assets/images/eptg-section-banner-data-storage-version.png)]

So we now have our development environment. However, the data for us to
conduct EDA and predictive modeling on is nowhere in sight.

Since the context of this guide is within the Google Cloud Platform,
we will be making use of its
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
service for remote and object storage.

In most cases, raw data for 100E projects provided by the project
sponsors are uploaded to GCS through AI Singapore's
in-house tool for uploading data: UDP. When data is uploaded to GCS
through UDP, a GCS bucket is populated with timestamped directories
containing whatever raw that was uploaded.

For example, assuming your project ID is `ai-proj-aut0`,
a GCS bucket with the same name `ai-proj-aut0` exists. The tree in the
bucket can look something like this:

```bash
.
└── ai-proj-aut0
    ├── 20211214_1109568/
    ├── 20211214_1110821/
    ├── 20211214_1448200/
    └── 20211214_1449172/
```

The subdirectories are timestamps indicative of the time that the raw
data was added to GCS. A question that follows is how do we get
the data into the persistent storage that's accessible by Polyaxon's
jobs and services? Well, let's go back to the VSCode environment to use
the integrated terminal.

From [this section](#cloud-sdk-for-development-environment),
we've learned how to set up authorisation for `gcloud`
to use the service account
credentials we have attached to the service containers.
This means that we can use
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
to pull in data from a GCS bucket.

```bash
$ mkdir -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/ai-proj-aut0 && cd "$_"
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://ai-proj-aut0 .
```

The `-m` flag is to utilise parallel synchronisation which would speed
things up and the `-r` concerns recursion through a bucket/directory.

Now, when a new set of raw data has been uploaded, a new subdirectory
will appear in the bucket. Say the tree now looks like the following:

```bash
.
└── ai-proj-aut0
    ├── 20211215_0952332/
    ├── 20211214_1109568/
    ├── 20211214_1110821/
    ├── 20211214_1448200/
    └── 20211214_1449172/
```

To retrieve that new set of raw data i.e. the folder `20211215_0952332`,
just run the same command in the relevant folder again:

```bash
$ cd /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/ai-proj-aut0
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://ai-proj-aut0 .
```

The `gsutil` utility will synchronise the directory in the persistent
storage with the remote object storage/bucket.
With that said, __do not place your processed data directory within
this same directory containing all the raw data__ lest you'd lose
the processed data upon sychronisation. Let the directory for raw data
contain just raw data.

### Sample Data

While you may have your own project data to work with, for the purpose
of following through with this template guide, let's download
the sample data for the [problem statement](#guides-problem-statement)
at hand.

__Note:__ The sample data for this guide's problem statement is made
accessible to the public. Hence any team or individual can download
it. It is highly likely that your data is not publicly accessible and
neither should it be, especially if it is a 100E project.

```bash
$ mkdir -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/acl-movie-review-data-aisg && cd "$_"
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://acl-movie-review-data-aisg .
```

In the following section, we will work towards processing the raw data
and eventually training a sentiment classifier model.

- [`gsutil` Reference - rsync](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync)

## Job Orchestration

![Job Orchestration Section](./assets/images/eptg-section-banner-job-orc.png)

Jobs are submitted to the Polyaxon server and executed within Docker
containers. These images are either pulled from a registry or built upon
a job's submission. The names and definitions of images are specified in
Polyaxonfiles. Using these images, Kubernetes pods are spun up to
execute the entry points or commands defined, tapping on to the
Kubernetes cluster's available resources.

Any jobs that are submitted to the Polyaxon server can be tracked and
monitored through Polyaxon's dashboard. See [this section](#polyaxon-dashboard)
on how to access the dashboard for Polyaxon and create a project.

### Pipeline Configuration

In this template, Hydra is the configuration framework of choice for the
data preparation and model training pipelines script (or any
pipelines that doesn't belong to the model serving aspects).

The configurations for logging, pipelines and hyperparameter tuning
can be found under `conf/base`. These YAML files are then referred to
by Hydra or general utility functions
(`src/{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}/general_utils.py`)
for loading of parameters
and configurations. The defined default values can be overridden through
the CLI.

It is recommended that you have a basic understanding of Hydra's
concepts before you move on.

Reference(s):

- [Hydra Docs - Basic Override Syntax](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/)

### Data Preparation & Preprocessing

To process the sample raw data,
we will be spinning up a job on Polyaxon.
This job will be using a Docker image that will be built from
a Dockerfile (`docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-data-prep.Dockerfile`)
provided in this template:

```bash
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/data-prep:0.1.0 \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-data-prep.Dockerfile .
$ docker push asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/data-prep:0.1.0
```

Assuming you're still connected to the Polyaxon server through
port-forwarding, submit a job to the server like such:

```bash
$ polyaxon run -f aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/process-data.yml -P DOCKER_IMAGE="asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/data-prep:0.1.0" -p {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME> \
  -P RAW_DATA_DIRS='["/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/acl-movie-review-data-aisg/aclImdb-aisg-set1"]' \
  -P PROCESSED_DATA_DIR="/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/processed/aclImdb-aisg-combined" \
  -P WORKING_DIR="/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}"
```

If you were to inspect
`aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/process-data.yml`,
the second command with `yq` overwrites the list of directories
specified in the config file `conf/base/pipelines.yml` for the key
`.data_prep.raw_dirs_paths`. You may specify a list of directory paths
with which you can process and combine the results into one single
directory.

__Note:__ The `yq` utility is used to overwrite the values in the YAML
config as
[Hydra currently doesn't support modification of list in YAML files](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/issues/1547).

After some time, the data processing job should conclude and we can
proceed with training the predictive model.

The processed data is exported to the directory
`/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/processed/aclImdb-aisg-combined`
. We will be passing this path to the model training workflows.

### Model Training

Now that we have processed the raw data, we can look into training the
sentiment classification model. The script relevant for this section
is `src/train_model.py`. In this script, you can see it using
some utility functions from
`src/{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}/general_utils.py`
as well, most notably the functions for utilising MLflow utilities
for tracking experiments. Let's set up the tooling for experiment
tracking before we start model experimentation.

#### Experiment Tracking

In the module `src/{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}/general_utils.py`,
the functions `mlflow_init` and `mlflow_log` are used to initialise
MLflow experiments as well as log information and artifacts relevant
for a run to a remote MLflow Tracking server.
An MLflow Tracking server is usually set up within a GKE cluster for
projects that requires model experimentation.
Artifacts logged through the MLflow API can be
uploaded to GCS buckets, assuming the client is authorised for
access to GCS.

__Note:__ The username and password for the MLflow Tracking server
can be retrieved from the MLOps team or your team lead.

To log and upload artifacts to GCS buckets through MLflow, you need to
do the following first:

1. Ensure that the Polyaxon job for model experimentation is configured
   to use your GCP project's service account credentials.
   See
   ["Secrets & Credentials on Kubernetes"](#secrets--credentials-on-kubernetes)
   on how to do this.
2. Create a bucket for storing such artifacts on GCS.
3. Create an MLflow experiment on the tracking server.

Let's create a GCS bucket
for storing all your model experiment artifacts (assuming the bucket
has yet to be created):

```bash
$ gsutil mb -p {{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}} -c STANDARD -l ASIA-SOUTHEAST1 -b on gs://{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-artifacts
Creating gs://{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-artifacts/...
```

Now, let's access the MLflow Tracking server's dashboard. Open a
separate terminal and run the following:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward service/mlflow-nginx-server-svc 5005:5005 --namespace=polyaxon-v1
```

Head over to your web browser and access the following URL:
`http://localhost:5005`. You should be presented with an interface
similar to the one below:

![MLflow - Dashboard Experiments View](./assets/screenshots/mlflow-dashboard-exps-view.png)

We are to collate runs under experiments (see
[here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#organizing-runs-in-experiments)
for the distinction between runs and experiments) and for each
experiment, we can specify paths and URLs for which we will upload
artifacts to.

![MLflow - Create Experiment (Button)](./assets/screenshots/mlflow-dashboard-create-exp-button.png)

![MLflow - Create Experiment (Input)](./asssets/screenshots/../../assets/screenshots/mlflow-dashboard-create-exp-input.png)

__Note:__ Here are some things to take note when creating an experiment:

- Specifying of object storage paths for a new experiment
through MLflow's CLI does not work well currently so we would have
to make do with creation of experiments through the UI.
- It is highly recommended that experiment names are
  __without whitespaces__. Words can be concatenated with hyphens.

#### Container for Experiment Job

Before we submit a job to Polyaxon to train our model,
we need to build the Docker image to be used for it:

```bash
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/model-train:0.1.0 \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-model-training-gpu.Dockerfile .
$ docker push asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/model-train:0.1.0
```

Now that we have the Docker image pushed to the registry,
we can run a job using it:

```bash
$ export MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=<MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME>
$ export MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=<MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD>
$ export CLUSTER_IP_OF_MLFLOW_SERVICE=$(kubectl get service/mlflow-nginx-server-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}' --namespace=polyaxon-v1)
$ polyaxon run -f aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/train-model-gpu.yml -P DOCKER_IMAGE="asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/model-train:0.1.0" -p {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME> \
  -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=$MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=$MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD \
  -P SETUP_MLFLOW=true -P MLFLOW_AUTOLOG=true \
  -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://$CLUSTER_IP_OF_MLFLOW_SERVICE:5005" -P MLFLOW_EXP_NAME=<MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME> \
  -P WORKING_DIR="/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}" \
  -P INPUT_DATA_DIR="/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/processed/aclImdb-aisg-combined"
```

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

For many ML problems, we would
be bothered with finding the optimal parameters to train our models
with. While we are able to override and set the values for the
parameters for our model training workflows, imagine having to sweep
through a distribution of values with steps within a set range. For
example, if you were seek for the optimal learning rate for training
our model within a log space, we would have to execute
`polyaxon run` multiple times manually just to provide the training
script with different learning rate value each time. It is reasonable
that one seeks for ways to automate this workflow.

[Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an optimisation
framework designed for ML use-cases. Its API allows for ease of
modularity and it has many optimisation algorithms that ML engineers
can make use of. It also allows for
[paralellisation](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/10_key_features/004_distributed.html)
resulting in faster sweeps. Also, Hydra has a plugin for utilising
Optuna which further translates to ease of configuration.

To use Hydra's plugin for Optuna, we have to provide further overrides
within the YAML config, and this is observed in
`conf/base/train-model-hptuning.yml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  - override hydra/sweeper: "optuna"
  - override hydra/sweeper/sampler: "tpe"

hydra:
  sweeper:
    sampler:
      seed: 123
    direction: ["minimize", "maximize"]
    study_name: "sentiment-classification"
    storage: null
    n_trials: 3
    n_jobs: 1

    search_space:
      train.val_split:
        type: "float"
        low: 0.2
        high: 0.35
        step: 0.025
      train.optimiser:
        type: "categorical"
        choices: ["adam", "rmsprop"]
```

The fields defined are terminologies used by Optuna. Therefore, it is
recommended that you understand the basics of the tool.
[This overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6NwZVl8ttc)
covers well on the concepts brought upon by Optuna.

The script with which hyperparameter tuning is conducted,
`src/train_model_hptuning.py`, there's essentially 2 lines that are
different from `src/train_model.py`:

```python
...
@hydra.main(config_path="../conf/base", config_name="train-model-hptuning.yml")
...
    return test_loss,test_acc
```

The first change specifies the different config file needed for
utilising the Optuna plugin. The second one is needed for Optuna
to judge the performance of the objectives (i.e. metrics) within each
iteration, or as they put it, "trials".

Another difference with this workflow is that for each trial with a
different set of parameters, a new MLflow run has to be initialised.
However, we need to somehow link all these different runs together so
that we can compare all the runs within a single Optuna study (set of
trials). How we do this is that we provide the script with a
tag (`hptuning_tag`) which would essentially be the date epoch value of the moment
you submitted the job to Polyaxon. This tag is defined using the
environment value `MLFLOW_HPTUNING_TAG`.

```bash
$ export MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=<MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME>
$ export MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=<MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD>
$ export CLUSTER_IP_OF_MLFLOW_SERVICE=$(kubectl get service/mlflow-nginx-server-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}' --namespace=polyaxon-v1)
$ polyaxon run -f aisg-context/polyaxon/polyaxonfiles/train-model-gpu-hptuning.yml -P DOCKER_IMAGE="asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/model-train:0.1.0" -p {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-<YOUR_NAME> \
  -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=$MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=$MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD \
  -P SETUP_MLFLOW=true -P MLFLOW_AUTOLOG=true \
  -P MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://$CLUSTER_IP_OF_MLFLOW_SERVICE:5005" -P MLFLOW_EXP_NAME=<MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME> \
  -P WORKING_DIR="/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}" \
  -P INPUT_DATA_DIR="/polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/processed/aclImdb-aisg-combined" \
  -P MLFLOW_HPTUNING_TAG="$(date +%s)"
```

Say the tag is `1641159546`, you can then filter this within MLflow's
dashboard for runs with the associated tag like such in the search bar:
`tags.hptuning_tag="1641159546"`.

## Deployment

![Deployment Section](./assets/images/eptg-section-banner-deploy.png)

Assuming we have a predictive model that we are satisfied with, we can
serve the model within a REST API with which requests can be made to
and we will be provided with predictions.

Python has plenty of web frameworks that we can leverage on to build
our REST API. Popular examples include
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/),
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/). For this guide however, we will
resort to the following options:
the well-known [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (which is based
on Starlette itself) and an in-house implementation of
[Seldon Core](https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/core/), Kapitan
Scout.

Reference(s):

- [IBM Technology - What is a REST API? (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMQRaeKNDk)

### Model Artifacts

Seen in ["Model Training"](#model-training), we have the trained models
uploaded to GCS through the MLflow Tracking server (done through
autolog). By default, each experiment run is given a unique ID. When
artifacts uploaded to GCS through MLflow, the artifacts are located
within directories named after the unique IDs of the runs.
This guide by default uploads your artifacts to the following
directory on GCS:
`gs://{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-artifacts/mlflow-tracking-server`.
Artifacts for specific runs will be uploaded to a directory with the
following convention:
`gs://{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-artifacts/mlflow-tracking-server/<MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_UUID>`.
With this path/URI, we can use
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
to download the predictive model from GCS into a mounted volume when
we run the Docker image for the REST APIs.

Now that we have established on how we are to obtain the models for the
API server, let's look into the servers themselves.

### Model Serving (FastAPI)

FastAPI is a web framework that has garnered much popularity in recent
years due to ease of adoption due to its comprehensive tutorials, type
and schema validation, async capable and automated docs, among other
things. These factors have made it a popular framework within
AI Singapore across many projects.

If you were to inspect the `src` folder, you would notice that there
exist more than one package: `{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}` and
`{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}_fastapi`. The former contains the modules for
executing pipelines like data preparation and model training while
the latter is dedicated to modules meant for the REST API. Regardless,
the packages can be imported by each other.

__Note:__ It is recommended that you grasp some basics of the FastAPI
framework, up till the
[beginner tutorials](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) for
better understanding of this section.

Let's try running the boilerplate API server on a local machine.
Before doing that, identify from the MLflow dashboard the unique ID
of the experiment run that resulted in the predictive model that you
would like to serve.

![MLflow - Dashboard Run View](./assets/screenshots/mlflow-dashboard-run-view.png)

Now that we have obtained the ID of the MLflow run,
let's download the model that we intend to serve.
Assuming you're in the root of this template repository, execute the
following commands:

```bash
$ export PRED_MODEL_UUID="<MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_UUID>"
$ export PRED_MODEL_GCS_URI="gs://{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-artifacts/mlflow-tracking-server/$PRED_MODEL_UUID"
$ gsutil cp -r $PRED_MODEL_GCS_URI ./models
```

With the above, the model for the experiment
`7251ac3655934299aad4cfebf5ffddbe` is downloaded to the subdirectory
`./models`. However, the subdirectory that is relevant for TensorFlow
to load will be
`./models/<MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_UUID>/artifacts/model/data/model`. Let's
export this path to an environment variable:

```bash
$ export PRED_MODEL_PATH="$PWD/models/$PRED_MODEL_UUID/artifacts/model/data/model"
```

#### Local Server

Run the FastAPI server using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org):

```bash
$ cd src
$ gunicorn {{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}_fastapi.main:APP -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
```

__Note:__ See
[here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/server-workers/) as to
why Gunicorn is being used instead of just
[Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/). TLDR: Gunicorn is needed to spin
up multiple processes/workers to handle more requests i.e. better for
the sake of production needs.

In another terminal, use the `curl` command to submit a request to the API:

```bash
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -X POST -d '{"reviews": [{"id": 9176, "text": "This movie is quite boring."}, {"id": 71, "text": "This movie is awesome."}]}' \
  localhost:8080/api/v1/model/predict
```

With the returned JSON object, we have successfully submitted a request
to the FastAPI server and it returned predictions as part of the
response.

Now you might be wondering, how does the FastAPI server knows the path
to the model for it to load? FastAPI utilises
[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/), a library for data
and schema validation as well as settings management. There's a class
called `Settings` under the module
`src/{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}_fastapi/config.py`. This class contains
several fields: some are defined and some others not. The fields
`PRED_MODEL_UUID` and `PRED_MODEL_PATH` inherit their values from
the environment variables. This means that the export commands we
executed above were for setting the values for the server to refer to.

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation for
easy viewing of all the routers/endpoints you have made available for
the server. You can view the documentation through
`<API_SERVER_URL>:<PORT>/docs`. In our case here, it is viewable through
[`localhost:8080/docs`](http://localhost:8080/docs). It will look like
such:

#### Docker Container

We now look into packaging the server within a Docker container. This
process of containerising the server isn't just for the sake of
reproducibility but it makes it easier for the server to be deployed
on any server that can run a Docker container. A boilerplate
Dockerfile is provided to containerise the FastAPI server:

```bash
# Ensure that you are in the root of the repository
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-server:0.1.0 \
  --build-arg PRED_MODEL_UUID="$PRED_MODEL_UUID" \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-fastapi.Dockerfile .
```

The Docker build command above requires an argument to be passed and it
is basically the same unique MLflow run ID that was used above.
The ID would then be used to create environment variables that would
persist beyond the build time. When the container is being run,
these environment variables would be
used by the entrypoint script to download the relevant predictive model
into the mounted volumes and be referred to by the FastAPI Pydantic
models. Let's try running the Docker container:

```bash
# First make the `models` folder accessible to user within Docker container
$ sudo chgrp -R 2222 models
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -v <PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE>:/var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json \
  -v $PWD/models:/home/aisg/from-gcs \
  --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json \
  asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-server:0.1.0
```

Let's go through a couple of the flags used above:

- `--rm`: Automatically stops the container when it exits or when you
  stop it.
- `-p`: This binds port `8080` of the container to port `8080` of the
  host machine.
- `-v`: Bind mounts files or directories from the host machine to the
  container. In this case, we are mounting the SA file and the `models`
  folder to the container. The SA file is needed for `gsutil`
  to download the model from GCS and the `models` folder will persist
  the downloaded models.
- `--env`: This sets environment variables within the container.

Use the same `curl` command for the server spun up by the container:

```bash
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -X POST -d '{"reviews": [{"id": 9176, "text": "This movie is quite boring."}, {"id": 71, "text": "This movie is awesome."}]}' \
  localhost:8080/api/v1/model/predict
```

Push the Docker image to the GCR:

```bash
$ docker push asia.gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-server:0.1.0
```

With this Docker image, you can spin up a VM (Compute Engine instance)
that has Docker installed and run the container on it for deployment.
You can also deploy the image within a Kubernetes cluster for ease of
scaling.

#### Deploy to GKE

To deploy the FastAPI server on GKE, you can make use of the sample
Kubernetes manifest files provided with this template:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f aisg-context/k8s/model-serving-api/fastapi-server-deployment.yml --namespace=polyaxon-v1
$ kubectl apply -f aisg-context/k8s/model-serving-api/fastapi-server-service.yml --namespace=polyaxon-v1
```

To access the server, you can port-forward the service to a local port
like such:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward service/fastapi-server-svc 8080:8080 --namespace=polyaxon-v1
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

You can view the documentation for the API at
[`http://localhost:8080/docs`](http://localhost:8080/docs). You can also
make a request to the API like so:

```bash
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -X POST -d '{"reviews": [{"id": 9176, "text": "This movie is quite boring."}, {"id": 71, "text": "This movie is awesome."}]}' \
  localhost:8080/api/v1/model/predict
```

### Model Serving (Kapitan Scout)

> Coming soon...

## Batch Inferencing

Some problem statements do not warrant the deployment of an API server
but instead methods for conducting batched inferencing where a batch
of data is submitted to say a script and the script churns out
a set of predictions, perhaps exported to a file.

This template provides a Python script (`src/batch_inferencing.py`)
as well as an accompanying
Dockerfile (`docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-batch-inferencing.Dockerfile`)
for containerised executions.

To execute the script locally:

```bash
$ python src/batch_inferencing.py \
  inference.model_path=<PATH_TO_MODEL> \
  inference.input_data_dir=<PATH_TO_DIR_CONTAINING_TXT_FILES>
```

The parameter `inference.input_data_dir` assumes a directory
containing `.txt` files containing movie reviews. At the end of the
execution, the script will log to the terminal the location of the
`.jsonl` file (`batch-infer-res.jsonl`) containing predictions that
look like such:

```jsonl
...
{"time": "2022-01-06T06:40:27+0000", "filepath": "/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data/1131_2.txt", "logit_prob": 0.006387829780578613, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"time": "2022-01-06T06:40:27+0000", "filepath": "/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data/11020_3.txt", "logit_prob": 0.0041103363037109375, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"time": "2022-01-06T06:40:27+0000", "filepath": "/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data/11916_3.txt", "logit_prob": 0.023626357316970825, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"time": "2022-01-06T06:40:27+0000", "filepath": "/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data/3129_2.txt", "logit_prob": 0.00018364191055297852, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"time": "2022-01-06T06:40:27+0000", "filepath": "/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data/2444_4.txt", "logit_prob": 3.255962656112388e-05, "sentiment": "negative"}
...
```

The inferencing results are exported to a subdirectory within the
`outputs` folder. See
[here])(https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/working_directory/)
for more information on outputs generated by Hydra.

To use the Docker image, first build it:

```bash
$ docker build \
  -t asia.gcr.io/{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}/batch-inference:0.1.0 \
  --build-arg PRED_MODEL_UUID="abf043e8a8504eddb1f95bdbc634d2bd" \
  -f docker/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-batch-inferencing.Dockerfile .
```

Similar to how the predictive models are defined for the FastAPI
servers' images, `PRED_MODEL_UUID` requires the unique ID associated
with the MLflow run that generated the predictive model that you wish
to make use of for the batch inferencing.

After building the image, you can run the container like so:

```bash
$ chgrp -R 2222 outputs
$ docker run --rm \
  --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json \
  --env INPUT_DATA_DIR=/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data \
  -v <PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE>:/var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json \
  -v $PWD/models:/home/aisg/from-gcs \
  -v $PWD/outputs:/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/outputs \
  -v <PATH_TO_DIR_CONTAINING_TXT_FILES>:/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data \
  asia.gcr.io/{{cookiecutter.gcp_project_id}}/batch-inference:0.1.0
```

In Docker run command above we are passing two variables:
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `INPUT_DATA_DIR`.
The former allows the container's entrypoint to download the
predictive model specified during build time from GCS. The latter
will be fed to the script's parameter: `inference.input_data_dir`.
4 volumes are attached to the container for persistence as well as
usage of host files and directories.

- `-v <PATH_TO_SA_JSON_FILE>:/var/secret/cloud.google.com/gcp-service-account.json`:
  This attaches the JSON file for the service account credentials to
  the Docker container.
- `-v $PWD/models:/home/aisg/from-gcs`: The models downloaded to the
  host machine can be used by the container after being mounted to
  `/home/aisg/from-gcs`.
- `-v $PWD/outputs:/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/outputs`:
  This is for persisting the batch inferencing outputs to the outputs
  folder on the host machine.
- `-v <PATH_TO_DIR_CONTAINING_TXT_FILES>:/home/aisg/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/data`:
  To provide the container with access to the data that is on your local
  machine, you need to mount the directory containing the text
  files for inferencing.

## Continuous Integration & Deployment

![CICD Section](./assets/images/eptg-section-banner-cicd.png)

> Coming soon...

## Documentation

The boilerplate packages generated by the template are populated with
some
[Numpy formatted docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
. What we can do with this is to observe how
documentation can be automatically generated using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
, with the aid of the
[Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)
extension. Let's build the HTML asset for the documentation:

```bash
# From the root folder
$ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs src
$ sphinx-build -b html docs public
```

![Sphinx - Generated Landing Page for Documentation Site](./assets/screenshots/sphinx-generated-doc-landing-page.png)

### GitLab Pages

Documentation generated through Sphinx can be served on
[GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), through
GitLab CI/CD. With this template, a default CI job has written under
`.gitlab-ci.yml` to serve the Sphinx documentation when pushes are
done to the `master` branch:

```yaml
...
pages:
  stage: deploy-docs
  image:
    name: continuumio/miniconda:4.7.12
  script:
  - conda env update -f {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env.yml
  - conda init bash
  - source ~/.bashrc
  - conda activate {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}
  - sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs src
  - sphinx-build -b html docs public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
...
```

The documentation page is viewable through the following convention:
`<GROUP>.gitlab.aisingapore.net/<PROJECT_NAME>` or
`<GROUP>.gitlab.aisingapore.net/<SUBGROUP>/<PROJECT_NAME>`.
