## Preface

This repository contains the
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
template for generating a repository that provides boilerplates touching
on the differing components of an end-to-end ML project. This template
is dedicated for the GCP environment.

## Usage

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/460803.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/460803)

To use the template and create a repository, you would need to
[install the `cruft` CLI](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/)
, say within a virtual environment and pass the URL of this template as
an argument, like such:

```bash
$ pip install cruft
$ cruft create https://github.com/aimakerspace/ml-project-cookiecutter-gcp
```

__Note:__ `cruft` can quickly validate whether or not a project is using
the latest version of a template using `cruft check`.

You will then be prompted to provide inputs.These inputs will be used to
populate different parts of the repository to be generated by
`cookiecutter`.

### Version Control

Following the creation of your repository,
initialise it with Git, push it to a
remote, and follow its
`README.md` document for a full guide on its usage.

### Updating Template Repository

Over time, this `cookiecutter` template will be updated. The first time
you create the template repository using `cruft`, it a `.cruft.json`
file is created as well. This JSON configuration file details
the latest commit hash of this `cookiecutter` template it was derived
from. When you execute `cruft check`, if the commit hash
in `.cruft.json` differs from the latest commit hash that exist
on the remote of this `cookiecutter` template, an error will be
returned.

```bash
$ cruft check
FAILURE: Project's cruft is out of date! Run `cruft update` to clean this mess up.
```

To compare the difference between your template repository
and the one that exists on the remote, you can run `cruft diff`
and see what changes would be applied should you execute
`cruft update`.

If you would like to exclude certain files or directories from
being affected by `cruft` updates, you can look into using the
`--skip` flag or configuration.
